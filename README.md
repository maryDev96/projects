In this project, we investigate the time complexity of a binary search tree and an AVL tree in terms of integer insertion and search. 
In this case, we will be dealing with trees of both types, which were created based on the insertionof randomly generated, sorted and nearly sorted integers.
For the procedure for searching for an integer, two scenarios are also used: when the desired number exists in the tree and when it does not. 
As a result the program stores data in three .txt files. In order to demonstrate difference between both tree types clearly the .R script was used to plot simple graphs.
